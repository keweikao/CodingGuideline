# Phase 0: Research & Technical Decisions

This document outlines the technical decisions made based on the feature specification and clarification session.

## 1. Target Platform

- **Decision**: Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Rationale**: This approach provides the best balance between development efficiency and user experience. It allows us to leverage the existing Next.js project structure while still delivering key app-like features such as an home screen icon and push notifications, which are critical for a daily engagement app.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Pure Web App**: Rejected because the lack of reliable push notifications and home screen presence would hinder user retention and the core "daily challenge" loop.
  - **Native App**: Rejected due to significantly higher development complexity and cost, requiring a new project codebase (e.g., React Native/Flutter) and abandoning the current Next.js foundation.

## 2. User Data Persistence

- **Decision**: Cloud-based accounts.
- **Rationale**: The user's progress and challenge status need to be synced across devices, which requires a centralized backend and user authentication.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Local Storage**: Rejected because it would confine user progress to a single device, which is not ideal for long-term engagement.

## 3. Activity Content Management

- **Decision**: Remote JSON file.
- **Rationale**: This hybrid approach meets the user's need for quick content updates without the complexity of a full-fledged CMS or database backend. It's simple to manage and cost-effective.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Hard-coded List**: Rejected because it fails the requirement for quick content updates.
  - **Full Backend/CMS**: Rejected as overkill for the initial MVP, adding unnecessary complexity and cost.

## 4. Challenge Progression Logic

- **Decision**: Self-paced progression.
- **Rationale**: The challenge advances only when the user completes the current day's tasks, regardless of calendar days passed. This provides a flexible, stress-free experience, aligning with the "self-love" theme.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Strict Daily Progression**: Rejected as it could create pressure and a sense of failure if a user misses a day.

## 5. Activity Customization

- **Decision**: Users can edit and replace suggested activities.
- **Rationale**: This provides personalization and flexibility, increasing user ownership and engagement with their self-love plan.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **No Customization**: Rejected in favor of providing a more personal and less rigid user experience.

## 6. Core Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **UI**: React, Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Vercel (assumed, as it's a common choice for Next.js)
